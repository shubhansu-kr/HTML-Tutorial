# HTML and CSS   

I took the [Codedamn's](https://codedamn.com/) [Learn HTML and CSS course](https://codedamn.com/learn/html-css) for learning the basics of Html and Css.  

Learned a lot of html tags(Can't list em' all) and Css styling properties.   

Made few basic webpages :
- Google search home page
- Subhash Chandra Bose Tribute page
- Project landing web page
- Google Form clone
