            <p>
                This is the start page for the SSH (Secure Shell) protocol, software, and related information. SSH is a
                software package that enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks. It
                is used in nearly every data center and in every large enterprise.
            </p>
            <p>
                This page was created by the inventor of SSH, <a href="https://ylonen.org/" class="pg-link">Tatu
                    Ylonen</a> (twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/tjssh" class="pg-link">@tjssh</a>). He wrote
                ssh-1.x and
                ssh-2.x, and still works on related topics. The open source OpenSSH implementation is based on his free
                version.

            <p>
                The SSH protocol uses encryption to secure the connection between a client and a server. All user
                authentication, commands, output, and file transfers are encrypted to protect against attacks in the
                network. For details of how the SSH protocol works, see the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/"

            <h1>History of the SSH protocol</h1>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/" class="pg-link">Secure Shell protocol</a> was originally
                developed by <a href="https://ylonen.org/" class="pg-link">Tatu Ylonen</a> in 1995 in response to a
                hacking
                incident in the Finnish university network. A password sniffer had been installed on a server connected
                directly to the backbone, and when it was discovered, it had thousands of usernames and passwords in its
                database, including several from Ylonen's company.
            </p>
            <p>
                That incident triggered Ylonen to study cryptography and develop a solution he could use himself for
                remote login over the Internet safely. His friends proposed additional features, and three months later,
                in July 1995, Ylonen published the first version as open source. It became OpenSSH. Later he took the
                protocol for standardization at the IETF and designed the <a href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/sftp/"
                    class="pg-link">SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)</a>. He founded
                SSH Communications Security Corp in December 1995 to provide commercial support for the protocol.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ylonen still works on topics related to Secure Shell, particularly around key management, as well as
                broader cybersecurity topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, the protocol is used for managing more than half of world’s web servers and practically every
                Unix or Linux computer, on-premise and in the cloud. Information security specialists and system
                administrators use it to configure, manage, maintain, and operate most firewalls, routers, switches, and
                servers in the millions of mission-critical networks and environments of our digital world. It is also
                embedded inside many file transfer and systems management solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new protocol replaced several legacy tools and protocols, including <a

                In this video we will learn the fundamentals of SSH along with some basic DevOps and Linux stuff. We
                will
                start with a local Ubuntu server on my network and then create a remote Digital Ocean Droplet to work
                with. We will create sets of SSH keys for those as well as Github. We will even do a simple React app
                deployment.

<!-- 
    You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. 
    Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have 
    covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. 
    You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies 
    (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended 
    for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects 
    will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like 
    React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the 
    suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!
