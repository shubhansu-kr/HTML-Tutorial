            Subhas Chandra Bose, (born Jan. 23, 1897, Cuttack, Orissa, 
            India—died Aug. 18, 1945, Taipei, Taiwan [China]?), Indian 
            revolutionary. Preparing in Britain for a career in the 
            Indian civil service, he resigned his candidacy on hearing 
            of nationalist turmoil back home. Sent by Mohandas K. Gandhi 
            to organize in Bengal, he was deported and imprisoned several
            times. He favoured industrialization, which put him at odds 
            with Gandhi’s economic thought, and, though he was elected 
            president of the Indian National Congress in 1938 and 1939, 
            without Gandhi’s support he felt bound to resign. He slipped 
            out of India in 1941 and carried on his struggle against the 
            British from Nazi Germany and later from Southeast Asia. In 
            1944 he invaded India from Burma (Myanmar) with a small army 
            of Indian nationals and Japanese, but his army was soon 
            forced to retreat. He fled Southeast Asia after the Japanese 
            surrender in 1945 and died of burns suffered in a plane 
            crash.

    or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at 
    your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with 
    different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to 
    fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for 
    this project. Happy coding!
