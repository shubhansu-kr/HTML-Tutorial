    So far, all the properties in the challenges apply to the flex 
    container (the parent of the flex items). However, there are several 
    useful properties for the flex items

    The first is the flex-shrink property. When it's used, it allows an 
    item to shrink if the flex container is too small. Items shrink when 
    the width of the parent container is smaller than the combined widths
    of all the flex items within it.

    The flex-shrink property takes numbers as values. The higher the 
    number, the more it will shrink compared to the other items in the 
    container. For example, if one item has a flex-shrink value of 1 and 
    the other has a flex-shrink value of 3, the one with the value of 3 
    will shrink three times as much as the other.

    The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property. Recall that 
    flex-shrink controls the size of the items when the container shrinks.
    The flex-grow property controls the size of items when the parent 
    container expands.

    Using a similar example from the last challenge, if one item has a 
    flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, the 
    one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other.
